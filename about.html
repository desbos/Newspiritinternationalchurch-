        <h1> The Church</h1>
        <div class="brief"> 
            <p>Newspirit church was given to our founder - Pastor Chike Williams Nwokeocha while in university second year in 2007, at Abia State University Uturu. It became very clear and obvious that the first phase will be from the campuses for the next move of God starting from the young people (Joel 2:28-30). However, Newspirit had her official inauguration for the campus phase at Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education Owerri, Imo State on 7th of December, 2014.

                <h4>THE NAME</h4>
                <p>Our Generic name is Newspirit International Church. The campus ministry is called Newspirit International Campus Church.</p>
                <h4>WHY NEWSPIRIT?</h4>
                <p>The name captures exactly what God told the vision bearer (see Ezekiel 11:19, 18:31, 36:26). Also it clearly depicts what/who we have become and/or what happened in us through/in Jesus (see Corinthians 5:17).</p>

                <p>Our emphasis is on NEW CREATURE. We did not take up a new flesh in this context, what happened took place in your spirit man, hence you are a Newspirit. Halleluyah!</p>

        <h3>Our Core Value</h3>
        <div class="core-content">
            <div>
                <p>
                    1.  <b>SOUL WINNING:</b> We reach out to the lost and unsaved souls, as to get them saved (receive Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior). We do this out of passion and in obedience to Matthew 28:19-20.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. <b>PRAYING IN TONGUES:</b> "For as many that believes in Jesus, to them gave he the power to become the sons of God" (John 1:2). The Christian faith is not sustained by physical strength, might or determination. There is a limit to the strength of your resolves, our life in Christ is made easier by the refreshing power we draw from the Holy Spirit (see Acts 1:8). As we pray in tongues/the spirit we build up ourselves and consistently align our spirit to the will of the Father (see Jude vs 20).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. <b>LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP:</b> God is love (1 John 4:8), therefore as God's representatives here on earth, we ought to express God and his nature in our world. Knowing that the Gospel we propel can be made futile in our hands if it cannot be expressed through us. (1 John 4:11-16, 1 Cor. 13:1-3).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    4. <b>CONSISTENT GIVING:</b> The work of God must move on and spread. This will be made possible and easy through material/financial resources (Zechariah 1:17). Giving consistently to the work of the ministry is one way to show love, value and commitment to God and the Gospel, furthermore the Household of Faith (Church) you belong to (see Matt. 6:19-21). We do not give as a form of exchange, escape from curses, gamble or competition. We give because we are blessed, passionate about the gospel and out of love. As we give to the Gospel, we also give to one another strategically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. <b>EXCELLENCE:</b> Being born again and mediocrity are no synonyms. It is of utmost importance that you excel in what your hands find to do (Academics, Business, Marriage, Ministry, Career, etc). The spirit we have received is an excellent one (Daniel 6:3). Excellence involves Commitment to work, Purposeful drive, Constant re-invention and going the extra mile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6. <b>LEADERSHIP BUILDING:</b> You are a leader, you lead in your sphere; peers, family, place of work, church, etc. We are poised to equip you with both the leadership spirit and the spirit of leadership. Such that you will be outstanding, proffer and produce results and be relevant to God as a leader in any sphere (see Proverbs 29:2, Esther 8:15).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p> 
                    7. <b>THE WORD:</b> You cannot separate us from the Word (Bible) - written and spoken. This is one of the ways (surest way) you can know God's intention/will for you per time. The word of GOD HIMSELF (John 1:1). All we believe, do and represent is found rooted in the word of GOD. Whatever is not established through/in the scripture cannot be acceptable amongst us in Newspirit International Church. Our teachings are also solely bible based.
